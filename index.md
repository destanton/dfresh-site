<h2>About</h2>

<p>Danielle is a Channel Systems Engineer for Polycom by day and an aspiring developer by night.
  She loves working on side projects using Ruby, Python, and React. She's currently learning 
  about AWS and the serverless ways of the future. She aspires to return to full-time programming one day. When she's not hacking away you'll likely find her riding her bike in the Blue Ridge Mountains, WOD'ing with her friends, or seeking out new adventure.</p>
<p>Danielle currently resides in Flat Rock, NC with her wife, Helen, and three fur kids.</p>
