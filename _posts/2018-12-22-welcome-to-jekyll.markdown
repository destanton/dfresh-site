I've been hacking around on side projects and decided to create a blog to serve as a brain dump.
I've also wanted to hand roll my personal website, so I decided to incorporate both of these things via Jekyll. So far it's been a fun project as I've decided to forego the default css theme and try to hand roll (mostly) my own. Let's just say I see an opportunity for future design course focus.

My site is pretty basic right now. I plan to add new features and make it more robust as time allows.

Jekyll comes with a lot of great features under the hood. I'm having fun learning my way around the site structure. The documentation is easy to follow and the community support is robust. If you're thinking about spinning up a [Ruby] site quickly, <a class="a-blog" href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">give Jeckyll a go!</a>

```ruby
def test
  puts "hello world"
end
```
